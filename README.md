This is an Dockerized and authentication-protected Todo App using Node.js, Express.js, bcrypt, JWT authentication, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. The app allows users to:

Register: Create a new account.
Login: Authenticate and receive a JWT token.
Manage Todos: Perform auth protected CRUD operations on their own todo tasks after logging in.
Project Structure
Hereâ€™s the corrected and complete project structure diagram for the auth-protected Todo App:


prisma/: Contains Prisma's schema (schema.prisma) and migration files. After each schema change, migration files are generated here to apply database changes.
public/: Contains the frontend HTML file. This file interacts with the backend API for user registration, login, and todo management.
src/: The core backend code.
controllers/ (optional): A directory to organize logic and separate it from the routes if needed in the future.
middlewares/: Contains middleware for handling JWT-based authentication, protecting routes that require authentication.
routes/: Contains API routes for handling authentication and CRUD operations for todos.
prismaClient.js: Sets up the Prisma client for database interaction.
server.js: The entry point for the Express.js application, which configures the app, routes, and middleware.
.env: Stores environment variables like DATABASE_URL and JWT_SECRET. These variables are used to configure Prisma, JWT, and database connections.
Dockerfile: The Dockerfile for building the Node.js application in a containerized environment.
docker-compose.yaml: Configuration for Docker Compose, which sets up both the Node.js app and PostgreSQL in separate containers.
package.json: Defines the Node.js dependencies and scripts used to run the application (e.g., npm start).
README.md: Project documentation, including setup instructions and directory structure (this file).
Example Workflow
Define or Update Schema: Modify the schema.prisma file to change your database structure.
Create Migrations: Use Prisma to generate and apply migrations.
Run Docker Compose: Build and run the Node.js app and PostgreSQL using Docker Compose.
Interact with the API: Use the frontend or API client (e.g., Postman) to register, login, and manage todos.
This project structure and workflow will help organize your code and make it easier to maintain and scale as your application grows.

Getting Started
Install Docker Desktop

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/backend-todo-app.git
cd backend-todo-app
Generate the Prisma Client:
npx prisma generate

Build your docker images:
docker compose build

Create PostgreSQL migrations and apply them:
docker compose run app npx prisma migrate dev --name init

Also - to run/apply migrations if necessary:

docker-compose run app npx prisma migrate deploy

Boot up 2x docker containers:
docker compose up

or

docker compose up -d

If you want to boot it up without it commandeering your terminal (you'll have to stop if via Docker Desktop though).

To login to docker PostgreSQL database (from a new terminal instance while docker containers are running) where you can run SQL commands and modify database!:
docker exec -it postgres-db psql -U postgres -d todoapp

To stop Docker containers:
docker compose down

To delete all docker containers:
docker system prune

Access the App:
Open http://localhost:5003 (or localhost:3000 if changed) in your browser to see the frontend. You can register, log in, and manage your todo list from there.

Emulating HTTP Requests (REST Client)
The REST Client file (todo-app.rest) is provided to help you test the API using HTTP requests directly. You can run these requests using the REST Client extension for VS Code or other compatible tools.

todo-app.rest
The todo-app.rest file includes requests for:

Registering a user: Sends a POST request to create a new user.
Logging in: Sends a POST request to authenticate a user and retrieve a JWT token.
Fetching todos: Sends a GET request to fetch the authenticated user's todos (JWT required).
Adding a todo: Sends a POST request to create a new todo (JWT required).
Updating a todo: Sends a PUT request to update an existing todo (JWT required).
Deleting a todo: Sends a DELETE request to remove a todo (JWT required).
How to Use the REST Client
Install the REST Client extension for VS Code.
Open todo-app.rest.
Run the requests by clicking on the "Send Request" link above each block of HTTP code.
Make sure to copy the token from the login response and replace {{token}} with the actual JWT token for protected routes.
Conclusion
This guide covers the main components of the app and how to get it up and running on your local machine. It highlights key considerations for Node.js version compatibility and provides a ready-to-use todo-app.rest file for testing. You can now explore the app's functionality, including authentication and CRUD operations on todos!
